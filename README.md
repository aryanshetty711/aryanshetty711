Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aryan Shetty, currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science at NYU, with a focus on Natural Language Understanding, Recommender Systems, and Generative AI. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Texas A&M University with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Economics. 

I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at OpenAds, enhancing ad recommendation by building an AI ad agency. As a Research Assistant at NYU Courant, I developed natural language understanding methods to evaluate large language models under Dr. Saining Xie's guidance. Previously, I was a Software Engineering Intern at Citrix Systems. My expertise includes Python, C++, JavaScript, SQL, TensorFlow, PyTorch, CUDA, and AWS.
