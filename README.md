Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aryan Shetty, and I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at New York University, with an emphasis in Deep Learning, NLP, and Predictive Analytics. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science, with a Minor in Economics, at Texas A&M University, graduating Magna Cum Laude. My primary interests lie in recommendation systems, software engineering, and academic research at the intersection of the two. I am experienced in building and fine-tuning machine learning models, designing data pipelines, and developing full-stack applications.

I currently work as a Machine Learning Engineer at OpenAds, where I've collaborated on a commercial relevance classifier for user searches on generative AI websites, improving recommendation accuracy for advertising. My role also involved fine-tuning scalable models on AWS. As a Research Assistant at NYU Courant, I implemented natural language understanding methods to evaluate large language models' abilities in generating creative text. My work here focuses on novel text evaluation metrics under the guidance of Dr. Saining Xie.

Previously, I have held roles at Highlight and Data Lab @ TAMU, where I designed models for client acquisition and extended anomaly detection platforms, respectively. My technical expertise includes Python, C++, JavaScript,SQL, and frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, CUDA, and AWS.

I'm passionate about using my skills to uncover cool insights about culture and human nature. If you'd like to discuss my experiences or explore collaboration opportunities, let's chat!
