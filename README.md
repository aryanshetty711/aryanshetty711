Howdy! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Aryan Shetty, currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science at NYU, with a focus on Natural Language Understanding, Recommender Systems, and Generative AI. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Texas A&M University with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Economics.

I currently work as a Machine Learning Engineer at OpenAds, where I've collaborated on a commercial relevance classifier for user searches on generative AI websites, improving recommendation accuracy for advertising. My role also involved fine-tuning scalable models on AWS. As a Research Assistant at NYU Courant, I implemented natural language understanding methods to evaluate large language models' abilities in generating creative text. My work here focuses on novel text evaluation metrics under the guidance of Dr. Saining Xie. Previously, I have held roles at Highlight and Data Lab @ TAMU, where I designed models for client acquisition and extended anomaly detection platforms, respectively. At NYU Courant, I researched text evaluation metrics under Dr. Saining Xie. My expertise includes Python, C++, JavaScript, SQL, TensorFlow, PyTorch, CUDA, and AWS.

I'm passionate about using my skills to uncover cool insights about culture and human nature. If you'd like to discuss my experiences or explore collaboration opportunities, let's chat!
